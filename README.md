Path@Penn — Stage 4: HTML/CSS Prototype

This repo has a static HTML/CSS version of the opening screen from my high-fidelity Path\@Penn prototype. I designed it for a phone size (390×844) to match the mobile layout.

The screen shows the app header with the term, a big rounded search bar with an icon, a “Recommended Course” section, three course cards with info (time and seats left), and a “View Cart” button at the bottom. It’s meant to look like my high-fidelity mock, but nothing is clickable since the assignment only asked for a static version.

How to run:
- Just open `index.html` in any browser (Chrome, Safari, etc). No setup needed.
- Or just use the GitHub Pages live link.

Files:
- `index.html` – main page
- `style.css` – styles (simple CSS, mobile-first)
- (no JavaScript)

Notes:
- I set the phone frame to 390×844 so it looks right on desktop.
- The font is Inter from Google Fonts, with regular fallbacks.
- I used navy/gray colors similar to my mockup, but you can change them in `:root` if needed.


Attributions:
- I used ChatGPT to help me start the HTML and CSS. It gave me the basic layout and style ideas, and then I edited it to fit my design and made sure I understood the code. I only used it for plain HTML/CSS.
- The magnifying-glass icon is just a simple SVG I added myself.
